If folks feel the joystick works better for the old Gameboy games, I am willing to
test that out to my better judgment/opinion.

a configuration screen. If you know a way around this, please let me know.

######Tips and Tricks:

There is no quick save/load feature that I saw. Doing a save/load prompts for a slot number. 
You could work around this if you wish to give up a button on your gamepad to map to a number 
0-9 with the qjoypad program (future fix?)

#Mupen64Plus
#####################################

Suggested emulator: Mupen64Plus
Alternative emulators: Project64

######Default Controller layout:

    Primary Control: Joystick
    Dpad enabled
    A (A)
    B (X)
    C Buttons (Right Joystick)
    LT (LB)
    RT (RB)

    Start (Start)
    Select (Select)
    Exit emulator (Guide)
    Quick Save State (Left-Thumbstick)
    Quick Load State (Right-Thumstick)

######Tips and Tricks:

The Mupen64Plus Google code site has superb documentation. Be sure to check it out for all intensive purposes.
There is a front end for Mupen64Plus called M64py. If you install the front-end GUI, be aware changes when 
opening up either Mupen64Plus via the CLI, or M64py will overwrite each other. The video plugin used is 
Glide64, due to video issues on Ubuntu 14.04 and my hardware. Your mileage may vary. 

Options to change the video plugin in the RetroRig settings menu will be added at a later date.
