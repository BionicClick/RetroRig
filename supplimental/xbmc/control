Description: XBMC Media Center (arch-independent data package)
 XBMC, recursive acronym for "XBMC Media Center", is an award winning free and
 open source software media-player and entertainment hub for all your digital
 media. XBMC is available for Linux, Mac OS X (Leopard, Tiger and Apple TV)
 and Microsoft Windows, as well as the original Xbox game console. Created in
 2003 by a group of like minded programmers, XBMC is a non-profit project run
 and developed by volunteers located around the world. More than 50 software
 developers have contributed to XBMC, and 100-plus translators have worked to
 expand its reach, making it available in more than 30 languages.
 .
 This package is derived from fernetMenta/XBMC, which is deployed in project "OpenELEC".
 FernetMenta XBMC supports dual monitors.
 Changes for RetroRig comprise: PS3 controller hotplug support, different application
 icons for XBMC in native and RetroRig mode, passing display settings to child processes.
 .
 This package contains all the architecture independent data needed to have a
 working XBMC.
